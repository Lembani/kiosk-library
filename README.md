# Kiosk Library Management System

> This is a Library Management system that is supposed to be used at a self service kiosk by students to automate the work of the librarian. This Kiosk system is being developed by incorporating the design pricniples of Human Computer interaction.

## Features
> Users

This is a high fidelity prototype and it enables the user to perform the following actions:
1. Checking out of Books
2. Book reservations
3. Borrow Books
4. Return Books
5. Locate Books
6. Show the number of Books that have been borrowed
7. Show the books that are available
8. Allow searching of Books

This is going to be used on a Kiosk, so this means it's going to be a touch screen. 

The system should use icons that are meant for touch screens and should be accessible to be read by screen readers.
The User interface should be optimised for touch screens.

The users of the system are students, the Adminstrator(Librarians), and members of staff.

> Admin panel

Highlights:
1. Show Borrowed Books

3. Show Available Books
4. Show books that have not been returned after the agreed date.
