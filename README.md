# kiosk-library prototype

This is a Library Management system that is supposed to be used at a self service kiosk by students to automate the work of the librarian. This Kiosk system is being developed by incorporating the design pricniples of Human Computer interaction.

This is a high fidelity prototype and it should be able to perform the following tasks:
1. Checking out of Books
2. Book reservations
3. Borrow Books
4. Return Books
5. Locate Books
6. Show the number of Books that have been borrowed
7. Show the books that are available
8. Allow searching of Books

This is going to be used on a Kiosk, so this means it's going to be a touch screen. 

The system should use icons that are meant for touch screens and should be accessible to be read by screen readers.
The User interface should be optimised for touch screens.

The users of the system are students, the Adminstrator(Librarians), and members of staff.

## Admin panel
The following should show on the admin panel:
1. Borrowed Books
2. Reserved Books
3. Available Books
4. Books that have nt been returned after the agreed date.
